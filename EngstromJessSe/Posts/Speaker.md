# Speaker
I love learning as much as sharing knowledge. As an international speaker, I had the fortune to travel the world sharing knowledge, speaking at conferences large and small like Microsoft Build, the .NET conference, NDC, Microsoft Ignite, Swetugg & Stir Trek.
Presentation skills are something I am very passionate about and I coach speakers in becoming better speakers.
