# Jessica Engstrom  
I love learning as much as sharing knowledge. As an international speaker, I've had the fortune to travel the world sharing knowledge, speaking at conferences large and small like Microsoft Build, the .NET conference, NDC, Microsoft Ignite, Swetugg & Stir Trek.
Presentation skills are something I am very passionate about and I coach speakers in becoming better speakers.


## Bio

Jessica is an international speaker, teacher, podcaster, mentor, geek and the CEO of her own company.

One of her passions is the developer community where she organizes conferences, events, streams, and runs multiple user groups. 
She's the co-hos of Coding After Work Podcast and Twitch channel.

She started out in the development world and soon realized that it was the user experience and interaction that really excited her.
One thing she's sure of is that you can never learn enough, and this is why she is continuously learning new things, researching, and trains with some of the best people in the world.
She does trainings and workshops in UX, Scrum, speaker skills and much more.
