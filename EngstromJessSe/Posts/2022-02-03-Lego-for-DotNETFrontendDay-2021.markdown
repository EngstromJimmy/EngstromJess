Last year, our good friend [Daniel Hindrikes](https://twitter.com/hindrikes), my husband Jimmy and I started [.NET Frontend Day](https://dotnet-frontend.com/). A free, full day of .NET frontend goodness.

We wanted to give a token of our appreciation to the speakers, and we decided on making a personalized Lego set for them.

## Lego sets

Let's take Jeff Fritz as an example.
He streams, he has a thing for hats and he has an amazing Blazor blazer.

Being swedes we had to get the Ikea "bygglek" - Lego boxes for storage and display.
We build a mini-studio for him, complete with all equipment, a green screen and a shelf for his hats. No streaming studio is complete without a StreamDeck, so we got Lego slopes and cut out tiny little buttons on a vinyl cutter. I liked how they turned out.

The magnificent sequin blazer was nothing Lego ever produced, so we had to get creative.

## Lego blasphemer?

I had to break more than one Lego rule in personalizing the sets.
Not only cutting our own stickers, that I think most Lego purist would be fine with. But painting a dog to resemble the real one

or going all glitter on Jeff's amazing sequin Blazer not to mention coloring his hair to match.

I think I'm okay with breaking a few rules when I know how they turned out and how ecstatic everyone was receiving the sets.

## Other fun details
Some of my favorite details was Stacy's Lego Lego set. She enjoys Lego IRL and is a huge fan of Doctor Who, so naturally her Lego self needed to reflect that.
Steve had an issue with his building's fire alarm during his talk, so he got a fire extinguisher.
David had a pants cam during covid so his Lego self naturally had to as well. Unlike David, the Lego figure actually forgot to wear pants! Sam is an awesome cross platform developer, so he needed a workstation for that.
Georgia (Fierce kitten) got an embroidery machine with a Live Coders hat. Mark enjoys the gym and his dog. Nico got a small shop where he can work on his bike and code at the same time.
