One thing that I'm very passionate about is sharing knowledge. It happens to be something I'm fortunate to be able to to on multiple levels. I speak at conferences, I stream, I have a podcast and most of all I teach.

I've tought more classes than I care to count, I love it. Due to the pandemic the number of occations went down drastically.  
After a year or so we slowly started to see courses going online. Now I don't mind doing things online, but we can't simply take in-person-conent and try do do it the same way online.
  Most of my classes have elements of open questions and discussions, hands-on assignments in groups or as individuals. 

Getting instant feedback, being able to read the room is invaluble. Is everybody onboard, is there one or more persons that doesn't understand what I'm saying. Do I need to explain it in a different way or is everyone already tired of me explaining the same thing in detail?
The school I mainly teach at uses excellerated learning and the class consists of a veriety of individuals with all kinds of backgrounds and experiences. So there are classes where the majority have worked in the developer world and there are classes where nobody have any experience of the field at all. 

Doing the same class but online gives me little feeback. Even though everyone have the camera on, I find it hard to read people like that.
You also need to respect the people who feel uneasy to unmute the microphone to "just react" to something. I have found that introverts or shy people sometimes find it even harder to react or speak up online compare to a small headnodd in a physical classroom. Some people simply can't unmute because they might not have the room to themselfs
  
  So I've compiled a list of some of the learnings and things I do to try to keep the same level of quality and interactivity when teaching online.
    
## Icebreaker
I have found that it really helps to break the ice no matter if the class already know eachother.

Either I do a "your name, your experience of the topic, a fun fact about yourself" and we quickly go around. 

It's amazing the fun things you can find out. I've heard everything from "I've lived in an exotic country for 10 years", "I used to work as " 

I've been absent from social media, blogging and the public life for a while for several reasons.

I had a close friend turn into a full-on stalker, which threw me for a loop mentally. Not only from the actual inappropriate behavior and stalking, but also because I didn't see it, I made excuses for him. 

Why didn't I see the signs so I could have prevented it? I have put so much blame on myself for his behavior. We lived with the curtains closed for over a year and I stopped all social and sharing services I could think of. I didn't feel safe talking the frequent walks I used to, since he knows what areas I usually go to and I was not up for meeting him "accidentally" in the woods.


I stopped keeping in contact with people because of my anxiety and shame, and because I was scared that someone would unknowingly tell him where I was, what I was doing or how I was doing.

He is a part of our local community, which has made it so much harder.

I didn't press charges or go public with it because he has kids, they don't deserve the pain that comes with a process like that.  
I still find myself looking over my shoulder to check if he has figured out where I am. Those moments don't come as frequent anymore, which I'm thankful for.

The pandemic has taken countless lives, and is nothing I would ever wish for, but it has also helped a lot with it being more acceptable not to be as socially active.
  

## My perfectionism
Although I'm not yet brave enough to design the blog myself, I have decided to deliver *some* value, perfect or not it's better than not sharing at all.


*So here I am, on a blog I didn't develop, with a theme I didn't design so I can start sharing again.*


I've removed all old blogposts, some dating back to 2011. I may add some back in the future, or an updated version of them. But if there are still here now, I know I will try to fix everything until I'm 100% satisfied; and that will never happen, so I think it is better this way. 
  
## My future
I've already started to go back to some social media platforms.
Our usergroup have moved to [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/codingafterwork) and we've taken up Lego again, which we also stream.  
My hopes are that on [MarriedGeeks](https://twitch.tv/codingafterwork) we will be able to branch out with other geek stuff as well in the future.



I'll leave you with what Debbie said on the panel;

<blockquote> Done is better than perfect</blockquote>
