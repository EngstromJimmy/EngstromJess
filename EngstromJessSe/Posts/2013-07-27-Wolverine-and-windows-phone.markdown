<p>Yesterday was the premier of the Wolverine in Sweden. <br>Since I surprisingly don't own a Wolverine T-shirt I had to pimp my nails instead.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I went with old-school inspired Wolverine and adamantium colored claws ;) <br></p> <p><a href="/PostImages/540_WolverineNokia.png"><img title="540_WolverineNokia" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="540_WolverineNokia" src="/PostImages/540_WolverineNokia_thumb.png" width="540" height="360"></a> </p> <p>Matching the yellow Lumia 920</p> <p><br>There was a lot of Nokias shown in the movie. <br>I like that Windows Phone now can be seen in blockbusters such as the Wolverine and Man of steel, it’s a good sign :) </p>
