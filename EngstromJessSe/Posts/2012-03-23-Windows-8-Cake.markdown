<p>The Windows 8 Consumer Preview was released close to our birthdays this year, which made the whole pick-a-cake-theme process really easy this year.<br>We are both early adopters and huge Microsoft fans so it just had to be a beta fish (or betta).</p> <p><br>Unfortunately the marbling in the blue doesn’t come through in the picture, neither does the two different reds and blues on the fish itself :/</p> <p><br><img alt="" src="/PostImages/2012%2f3%2f540BetaFish.png"><br><br></p> <p>The cake was filled with raspberries, vanilla, whipped cream and Dulce De Leche buttercream and covered with marzipan/sugar paste. The fish was made of sugar paste.</p>
