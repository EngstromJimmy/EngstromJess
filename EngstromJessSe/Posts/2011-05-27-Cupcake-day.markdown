<p>I've recently found an app for my windows phone 7 that I like more and more. It's a fun, quirky app that lists "themed days" like Mother's day, Mardi Gras and Cinnamon roll day. <br>It supports Live Tile so I don't have to miss out on such a day ever again. <br>It also lists lesser known days like International hug a musician day, Vegan Pizza day and Carrot day.</p> <p>"Temadagar" is only available in Swedish, at least for now (you could always send him a request :P) and can be found <a href="zune://navigate/?phoneAppID=772acd5f-6b47-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">here </a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img alt="" src="/PostImages/2011%2f5%2fmuffins.jpg"><br><br>Today is Cupcake day, and I just happened to have a new recipe for raspberry frosting I wanted to try, imagine that :P<br>It's probably the best frosting I ever made. Not too sweet and lots of raspberry taste.<br>The frosted cupcakes is lemon cupcakes and the others are tiger cupcakes (chocolate/vanilla)<br><br>Let's not speak about the fancy cake box :P</p>
