<h2>Background</h2>
<p>6 months ago or so I got tired of being overweight and got really motivated. I started to work out like crazy with about 9 classes per week and powerwalks almost everyday.<br /><br />After a while a friend steered me into a diet plan that I followed. It was basically max 50g carbs, max 1500 calories and minimum 2g/kg protein per day (so about 170g).<br />I did loose a total of 13 kg (29 lbs)<br />After a while I realized that I was all over the place and had no clear focus and needed help.<br /><br />So I got a PT, Long story short - it did NOT pan out. I lost 0.5kg (1 lbs), got bloated and basically should eat cod 50 times/week.</p>
<p>So I talked to my friend Iris about getting on the podcast if they wanted to help me and they did <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smile_11.png" alt="Smile" /><br />I was on the <a href="http://getupandcode.com/2013/12/07/get-up-and-code-31-building-a-fitness-plan-with-jessica-engstrom/" target="_blank">Get up and CODE</a> podcast in December to plan my food and workout regime.<br /><br /><br />We got delayed due to a blockage in my cervical vertebrae that induced constant migraine for weeks and weeks. My chiropractor has fixed that now so it&rsquo;s time to start. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_1.png" alt="Open-mouthed smile" /></p>
