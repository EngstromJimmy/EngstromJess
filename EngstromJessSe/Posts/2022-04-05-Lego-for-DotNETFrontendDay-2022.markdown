Last year, our good friend [Daniel Hindrikes](https://twitter.com/hindrikes), my husband Jimmy and I started [.NET Frontend Day](https://dotnet-frontend.com/). A free, full day of .NET frontend goodness. It was a huge success.
But without speakers and sponsors we wouldn't be anything.  

We wanted to give a token of our appreciation to the speakers and sponsors, so we decided on re-visiting Lego as a personalized gift for them.

## Lego sets

This year we opted for a Lego portrait. We commissioned [Marc Duiker](https://twitter.com/marcduiker) to do 8-bit portraits for everyone and then the work began.

## Parting out

We started out with a bunch of sets to get a good base of Lego dots. ![10 boxes of Lego](/EngstromJessSe/wwwroot/PostImages/2022/LegoBox.Smalljpg.jpg "Parting out 10 Lego kits")
Beatles was the one with most skin color options, and for colors we got a Marilyn Monroe and art project-kit.

## Making the kits

When [Jimmy](http://engstromjimmy.com/) Took the 8-bit images and worked some Lego-software magic to get the instructions we got hit with the realization that all Lego parts doesn't come in all Lego colors. So we had to do some more research and some switching of colors. You may now call me Lego dots color specialist! :laughing:

The amount of pieces we packed made me dream of dots for days. We packed 403 bags with 13244 pieces in total!
