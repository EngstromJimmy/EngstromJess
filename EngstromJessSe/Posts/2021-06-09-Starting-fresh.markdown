I was moderating a women in tech panel at Techorama last month with 4 fantastic women. Some of the things we touched on was mental health, impostor syndrome and perfectionism.

Being the moderator and not a panelist gave me the opportunity to relax, listen and get inspired.  
Not that I can't do that if I'm the panelist, but usually I'm cought up in preparing and delivering value.

It inspired me to be more open and start fresh. It doesn't have to be perfect.  
So here goes  
  
    
## My absence
I've been absent from social media, blogging and the public life for a while for several reasons.

I had a close friend turn into a full-on stalker, which threw me for a loop mentally. Not only from the actual inappropriate behavior and stalking, but also because I didn't see it, I made excuses for him. 

Why didn't I see the signs so I could have prevented it? I have put so much blame on myself for his behavior. We lived with the curtains closed for over a year and I stopped all social and sharing services I could think of. I didn't feel safe talking the frequent walks I used to, since he knows what areas I usually go to and I was not up for meeting him "accidentally" in the woods.


I stopped keeping in contact with people because of my anxiety and shame, and because I was scared that someone would unknowingly tell him where I was, what I was doing or how I was doing.

He is a part of our local community, which has made it so much harder.

I didn't press charges or go public with it because he has kids, they don't deserve the pain that comes with a process like that.  
I still find myself looking over my shoulder to check if he has figured out where I am. Those moments don't come as frequent anymore, which I'm thankful for.

The pandemic has taken countless lives, and is nothing I would ever wish for, but it has also helped a lot with it being more acceptable not to be as socially active.
  

## My perfectionism
Although I'm not yet brave enough to design the blog myself, I have decided to deliver *some* value, perfect or not it's better than not sharing at all.


*So here I am, on a blog I didn't develop, with a theme I didn't design so I can start sharing again.*


I've removed all old blogposts, some dating back to 2011. I may add some back in the future, or an updated version of them. But if there are still here now, I know I will try to fix everything until I'm 100% satisfied; and that will never happen, so I think it is better this way. 
  
## My future
I've already started to go back to some social media platforms.
Our usergroup have moved to [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/codingafterwork) and we've taken up Lego again, which we also stream.  
My hopes are that on [MarriedGeeks](https://twitch.tv/codingafterwork) we will be able to branch out with other geek stuff as well in the future.



I'll leave you with what Debbie said on the panel;

<blockquote> Done is better than perfect</blockquote>
