<p>The time (pun intended) has come to celebrate new year's and you got fancy clothes laid out, the table is all set with balloons, serpentines and party hats.<br />Then you realize that your Windows Phone is not up to par, what to do!?<br />Well I made a quick party hat for mine, and so can you :)<br /><br /><a href="/PostImages/WPDoctorWho2.png"><img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="WPDoctorWho2" src="/PostImages/WPDoctorWho2_thumb.png" alt="WPDoctorWho2" width="650" height="382" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I'm trying to fill the Doctor Who void any way I can :P<br /><br /><br /><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>If you want to opt for the superfast and easy way, cut the template out in cardstock and glue or tape the straight edges to each other and you are done.</p>
<p>For a fancier one that will stick together all through the party and look a bit better follow the instructions below.</p>

<p>1. Using printer paper (or tracing paper) draw and cut a circle. Mine was about 20cm (8inches)<br />Use a plate or bowl to make it easier to trace if you need.<br />Draw 2 lines through the middle of the circle.<br />Cut out 1/4th of the circle.</p>
<p>2. Place the template on cardstock (or other fancy paper) about 1cm (3/8 inch) <strong>above</strong> the edge.<br />Trace around the template.</p>
<p>3. Cut or fold down a small triangle (along the edge) in the &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Glue the allowance to the inside of the other edge.</p>
<p>5. And you are done!<br /><br /><br />Decorate the hat if you want.<br /><br />Now you and your phone can celebrate the new year looking awesome.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
