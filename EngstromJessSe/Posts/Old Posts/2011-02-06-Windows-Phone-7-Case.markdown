<p>Since I'm a WP7 hardcore fan and got my phone on the (Swedish) release day (4th in Scandinavia and 1st woman) there was no cases or pouches to buy. So I made my own. It's no secret that I love the design of the UI so I had to go with that. I guess I did something right because my brother wanted one for his phone too.</p> <p><br><img alt="WP7 Pouch" src="/PostImages/2011%2f2%2fr_IMG_0026.png"> The one on the left is a bit more sturdy and made of vinyl. The black one is two layers of felt. Nice use of the phone's accent colors on the pouch, right? :P</p>
