<p>Seriously tired today. Yesterday I was invited to the Build VIP party and after that we went to the hackathon to finish up our app. Unfortunately I only have my hybrid with me (without VS or Blend) so we were working on jess’s computer. But it’s about to collapse or something,&nbsp; couldn’t start Expression Blend, and Visual Studio couldn’t deploy to the phone no matter how many time we repaired and reinstalled :/ <br><br>The <strong>keynote</strong> contained a lot of good stuff like cool new functions in Visual Studio and Azure, they even made a 20 MB SQL server free for mobile services! <a href="/PostImages/IMG_3880%20(640x427).jpg"><img title="IMG_3880 (640x427)" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="IMG_3880 (640x427)" src="/PostImages/IMG_3880%20(640x427)_thumb.jpg" width="544" height="364"></a> <br>Push notifications is just a click away now. <br>And of course it’s always fun to see Scott Hanselman on stage.</p> <p>Azure Autoscale sure was awesome too, no more manual configuring! Speaking of saving money, Azure no longer charge you for every hour but per minute used <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smile_5.png"></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An awesome session about design was <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-150" target="_blank">Beautiful Apps at Any Size in Any Screen</a></strong> with Sarah McDevittwith.</p> <p>This was an awesome session about scaling your design for windows 8.1. She talked about what controller to use when and where, and how to make your design work over all different device sizes and orientation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the evening there was an <strong>attendee party</strong> at pier 48 with loads of food trucks inviting you to try everything from bacon burgers and Thai to Indian food and cupcakes. <br>There was a lot of games like pool, air hockey and arcade games to be played and they had an entertainer on stage too. <br>The view at&nbsp; the pier was fantastic at night, and kept getting better the darker it got</p> <p>.<a href="/PostImages/View.jpg"><img title="View" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="View" src="/PostImages/View_thumb.jpg" width="544" height="364"></a> <br>Now it’s time to regroup and get ready for the last day of the conference.</p>
