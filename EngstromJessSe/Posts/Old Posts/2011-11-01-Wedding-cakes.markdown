<p>I had the honor to get invited to Skelleftehamn by a friend to be a witness at their wedding, and make the cakes for the reception. The ceremony was small but very nice with just 3 witnesses. We had to go by boat (just a small one) to a lighthouse island. </p>  <p>The bride wanted 3 different simple, not tiered cakes. So I did my best. She was very happy and the guests seemed somewhat impressed.    <br /></p>  <p>It was a bit scary making someone's wedding cakes, she WILL remember it forever, success or failure. I’m glad my first time was for such a good friend, she would forgive me if I failed <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />     <br />Now I’m ready for the next challenge.</p>  <p>   <br /><a href="/PostImages/wedding2_1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="wedding2" border="0" alt="wedding2" src="/PostImages/wedding2_thumb_1.jpg" width="540" height="540" /></a>     <br />    <br />The white cake is filled with strawberries and whipped vanilla/wild strawberry frosting. The pale pink cake is filled with strawberry mousse and meringue mousse. The chocolate cake is an adaptation of Nigella Lawson's <a href="http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/chocolate-fudge-cake-168" target="_blank">chocolate fudge cake</a>. All the flowers are handmade with flower paste (gum paste) </p>
