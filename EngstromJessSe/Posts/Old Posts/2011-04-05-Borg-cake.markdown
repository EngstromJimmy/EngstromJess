<p>What better way to celebrate First Contact Day than to show you a recent cake I made?<br>Yeah, I know that first contact isn't until 2063 but what kind of geek would I be if I didn't mention it?<br><br>A friend of mine is a Borg, no really he is! At least it's his last name.<br>He also happens to be a Trekker so when his birthday came up he wanted an assimilated princess cake (common cake in Sweden).<br><br>So here it is, pale Borg skin, implants and all. And no Borg cake is complete without a "laser" (in this case an LED) </p> <p><img alt="" src="/PostImages/2011%2f4%2f540Small_r_img_0120.png"></p> <p>It was a bit hard not to make it with a nice finish, but hey it's a Borg!<br><br><br>For those of you who are into electronics or puns, this one's for you: <strong>Resistance is futile</strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="/PostImages/2011%2f4%2f540small_r_IMG_1091.png"></p> <p>Get it? Futile? No? :P (zero ohm resistor)<br><br>The cake is filled with raspberries, vanilla and whipped cream. Covered with sugarpaste/marzipan with a crumb coat of Dulce De Leche buttercream. All the black details (and the resistor) are made of chocolate modelingpaste. I brushed the cake with Vodka for a bit semi-slimy skin, but it doesn't show that well in the picture.<br><br>This was my first attempt of making modeling chocolate, but it turned out great. Not to mention how delicious it was. I'll have to try it again sometime.<br><br>Live long and prosper</p>
