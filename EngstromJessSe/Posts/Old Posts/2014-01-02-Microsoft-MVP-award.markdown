<p>2013 was a great year for me.</p>
<p>In January I got invited to join MEET Sweden (Microsoft Extended Expert Team) A complete honor.</p>
<p>I got the opportunity attend the &ldquo;Train the Trainer Windows Phone 8&rdquo; education in Utrecht.</p>
<p>Me and my <a href="http://www.apeoholic.se/" target="_blank">husband</a> went full on with our code heavy user group <a href="http://www.codingafterwork.se" target="_blank">Coding After Work</a>.</p>
<p>Coding After Work started to branch out to other cities, starting with Norrkoping.</p>
<p>We got to organize Easter-, Halloween- (as a part of Windows Phone week) and Xmas <a href="http://www.catoholic.se/post/Hackathon-season.aspx" target="_blank">hackathons</a>, a hackathon in Malmo and a hackathon with Atley Hunter and Michael Crump at &Oslash;redev.</p>
<p>Coding After Work also got to be exhibitors at <a href="http://www.oredev.org/" target="_blank">&Oslash;redev</a> and <a href="http://www.devsum.se/" target="_blank">DevSum</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft organize &ldquo;summer camp&rdquo; here in Sweden, where they offer free half day seminars to everyone. I got to talk there about Windows 8 UX.<br />That felt a bit crazy (good crazy) as I started in this community at summer camp myself a few years back. Circle is closed and all that :)</p>
<p>I committed to change my diet and workout schedule, lost 13kg (28 lbs) and I have more to lose so I was on the &ldquo;get up and code&rdquo; podcast. You can see more of this soon.</p>
<p>Conferences I attended was <a href="http://www.techx.se/" target="_blank">TechX sweden</a>, <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/" target="_blank">//Build</a>, <a href="http://www.oredev.org" target="_blank">&Oslash;redev</a>, <a href="http://www.devsum.se" target="_blank">DevSum</a></p>
<p>I went to &ldquo;Train the Trainer- Unity&rdquo; in Helsinki (loads of fun!)</p>
<p>The amazing people I got to meet during the year is fantastic. I treasure them all, mentors, beginners, young, old, all of them.</p>
<p>This is just a bit of the stuff I got to do. I thought that it would be hard to top 2013&hellip;.</p>

I got awarded Microsoft MVP (Client Dev) for my job in the community!</p>
<p>What a start of the year! People I look up to in the community are congratulating me, that is a surreal feeling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humbled to get nominated and awarded, and be in such an amazing category with so many great minds!<br />I will do my best to live up to he title.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that I wish you all a great 2014, may it be your best year ever!</p>
