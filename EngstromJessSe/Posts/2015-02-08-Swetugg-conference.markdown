<p>Back in April 2014 I met up with a couple of dev-friends over dinner and brainstormed ideas. Not only did we have good food, we also decided to do a Swedish, low-cost, .NET conference.</p>
<p>And so the planning began, we are 5 people on the board and we have another 7 members on our Swetugg Events committee.</p>
<p>It was super fun and a lot of work to put together a conference. None of us had done it before. Luckily two of the board members have awesome employers so they could take time to work on Swetugg during work hours and <a href="http://www.apeoholic.se" target="_blank">jess</a> and I do a lot of other events so we are used to planning stuff like this.</p>
<p>The hardest part about the conference was probably the schedule (besides finding a suitable venue). How do we decide if the speaker get a large or small room? How do we decide what topics to book? We were 3 people working on picking the talks and we are interested in different things so I think it worked out fine.</p>
<p>We got a lot of positive feedback during the event (and after) so based on that, I would say the event was a success <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile_3.png" alt="Open-mouthed smile" /></p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t only co-organize and work during the conference, I also did a talk about design.<br />My session concentrated on how to think when it comes to colors, typefaces, pictures and why. Also how to do an easy logo and icon for your app without having a designer on the team.</p>
