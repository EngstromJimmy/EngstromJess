<p>I love Windows 8 apps, I love the fact that I know instantly where to find the back button and how to get to the settings in (almost) ALL apps. That is a fantastic strength we should all utilize. <br>One of the things I’ve noticed and get asked quite a lot is that the app bar sometimes is neglected and that some of the rules isn’t that easy to keep track of, and I agree. Most people I’ve talked to don’t even know that there are guidelines for this. <br><br>I’m going to try to demystify the app bar with a blog series. I hope you enjoy!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here is a short introduction to the app bar. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The app bar is found in most windows 8 apps.</p> <p>The user activates the app bar with a swipe from the top to bottom or bottom to top, or by right clicking anywhere in the app.</p> <p>See it as a toolbar of sorts. You put all commands NOT related to search, share or settings here (or navigation, we are getting to that later). <br>Both contextual and global commands should be in the app bar.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font size="2">This is “</font><a title="Demystifying WIndows 8 app bar" href="http://www.catoholic.se/post/demystifying-Windows-8-app-bar.aspx"><font size="2">Demystifying Windows 8 app bar</font></a><font size="2">” part 1 of 8.<br>Part 2 “</font><a title="Ergonomics of the Windows 8 app bar" href="http://www.catoholic.se/post/Ergonomics-of-the-windows-8-app-bar.aspx"><font size="2">Ergonomics of the Windows 8 app bar</font></a><font size="2">”</font></p>
