<p>So in short this is what you should think about while designing your app bar. <br><br>* Most used buttons to the far sides of the app bar</p> <p>* Group similar buttons together</p> <p>* Use menus and flyouts to save space</p> <p>* Persistent buttons to the right <br>* If you have more than 3 persistent or more than 1 group, split them up</p> <p>* Contextual buttons always to the far left side, and never shown before they are usable <br>* Make the app bar sticky when you show contextual buttons</p> <p>* Additional (hidden/inactive) buttons should never move persistent buttons, place them to the side of them.</p> <p><br><a href="/PostImages/appbarrecap.png"><img title="appbarrecap" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="appbarrecap" src="/PostImages/appbarrecap_thumb.png" width="540" height="52"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are of course some exceptions to the rules ;)</p> <p>“New, “add”, anything that is used to create or add an item should always be placed to the far right. It should always use the + sign, and this is the only buttons allowed to use that. <br><br>”Delete” and “Remove” should always be to the left of “new” and “add” (so second to the right edge)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>“Select all” should always be to the far left.</p> <p><br>So there you have it, Windows 8 app bar all demystified :P</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font size="2">This is “</font><a href="http://www.catoholic.se/post/demystifying-Windows-8-app-bar.aspx"><font size="2">Demystifying Windows 8 app bar</font></a><font size="2">” part 8 of 8.<br></font>
